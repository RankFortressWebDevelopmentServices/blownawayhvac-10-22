                    If you want to make sure your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating,_ventilation,_and_air_conditioning">HVAC unit</a> is running smoothly, it’s essential to clean the coils on the back at least once a year. This is a simple task that anyone can do and will help keep your unit functioning properly. The coils on the back of the unit are where all the heat is released, so if they’re dirty, it can cause the team to work harder and may lead to premature failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To clean them, you’ll need a screwdriver to remove the cover, and then you can use a brush or vacuum to clean off the dirt and dust. It’s also important to check the filters regularly and replace them when they get dirty. A clogged filter can restrict airflow and cause the unit to work harder, leading to early failure. So make sure you change your filters regularly and keep those coils clean – it will help your HVAC unit run more efficiently and last longer.

                            Preventative maintenance is one of the most important things you can do for your HVAC unit. It’s simple and only takes a few minutes, but it can help to keep your unit running smoothly for years to come. One of the easiest things you can do is tighten all screws and bolts on the unit twice a year. This will help keep everything in place and prevent unnecessary wear and tear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You should also make sure to clean the unit regularly. Dust and dirt can build up over time and cause the unit to work harder than necessary. A quick wipe-down every couple of months should be more than enough to keep things clean. Lastly, consult a professional if you have any questions or concerns about your HVAC unit. They can help identify potential problems and recommend solutions before they become more significant issues.

                Make sure that the indoor unit is properly sealed to the window frame

            <p>
                A window <a href="https://www.blownawayhvac.com/the-benefits-of-annual-air-conditioning-maintenance">air conditioning</a> unit is a great way to cool a room without the expense of central air conditioning. However, if the unit is not sealed correctly, you may find that the cool air is escaping and your room is not being cooled as effectively as it could be. You can do a few things to ensure your window AC unit is properly sealed. First, ensure the unit is fitted correctly to the window frame.
            </p>
            <p>
                The AC unit should cover the window frame entirely, with no gaps or spaces between the two. If there are any gaps, use weatherstripping or caulking to fill them in. Second, make sure that the window itself is appropriately sealed. If there are any cracks or holes in the window, use caulk or weatherstripping to seal them up. If you follow these tips, you can ensure that your window AC unit works as efficiently as possible and that you are getting the most out of your investment.
